= plus2json Unhappy Events

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

This note documents enhancements to 'plus2json' to support unhappy path
audit event definition, JSON production and runtime play capability.

== 2 Introduction and Background

Supporting protocol verification of fully linked event sequences is the
heart of the Protocol Verifier.  However, applications exist which can
"fail" in expected ways violating the fully linked sequence of "happy
path" events.  These expected failures need to be recognised and reported
but not cause alarm conditions.

=== 2.1 Unhappy Events

The solution is to allow these "unhappy paths" to be detected and reported
without alarm by defining jobs with unhappy events in a collection
(package) along with the happy path sequences.  Various rules are applied
by the Protocol Verifier when the unhappy events are detected
(which is beyond the scope of this analysis note).

=== 2.2 Critical Events

A new designation of 'critical' has been added for normal path events.  A
critical event is one that should not be received if an unhappy path event
has been received in the same 'scope'.  'Scope' is defined in terms of
directed graph ancestry.  Two events (normal or unhappy) are in the same
scope if they share a common ancestor in the graph.

If an event designated critical is received and has a common ancestor with
an unhappy path event, then an alarm condition must be raised.

=== 2.3 Functional Extension of 'plus2json' for Unhappy and Critical

The 'plus2json' application must be extended to support the definition of
unhappy events and for tagging happy path events as 'critical'.
'plus2json' must enforce a syntax for this expression in a PLUS job
definition.  'plus2json' must then output a job definition in a
schema-compliant JSON format consumable by the Protocol Verifier.
Additionally, 'plus2json' must be capable of emitting runtime unhappy
events for testing purposes.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Unhappy Path Expression

. 'plus2json' shall support and enforce a syntax for unhappy path expression
  in the PLUS language (PlantUML dialect).
. A JSON schema shall be defined (updated) to express job definitions with
  unhappy path events in a format consumable by the Protocol Verifier.

=== 3.2 Job Definition JSON Production

. The class model at the base of 'plus2json' shall be updated to reflect
  rigorously an internal representation of unhappy path events.
. 'plus2json' shall convert the legally expressed PLUS into a JSON format
  which is compliant to the pre-defined schema.

=== 3.3 Runtime Event Production (--play)

* 'plus2json' shall be able to interpret job definitions containing unhappy
  path events and output them for testing purposes.

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.1 Definition versus Runtime Instance JSON

It is noted that the Protocol Verifier job definition format does not
affect applications which use the Protocol Verifier.  Therefore, the schema
for the job definition JSON can be made as expressive as necessary to
facilitate solid design functionality.  This is fully under Protocol
Verifier control.

The _definition_ of jobs is fully controlled by the Protocol Verifier, but
the shape of the _instances_ of received audit events is controlled more
by the users of the Protocol Verifier as will be noted in the next
paragraph.

It is also noted that the content of audit event instance streams is
largely defined outside the Protocol Verifier.  This means that the
primary content of runtime audit events is specified by the client and
harvested from the monitored application, which is not
controlled/specified by the Protocol Verifier.  This implies that the
schema for runtime audit event instance data is closely tied to
requirements flowing from users of the Protocol Verifier.

It can be stated that unhappy path audit event _instances_ will be of
the same format as normal sequenced event _instances_.  From the surface,
they will be indistinguishable from one another.  Unhappy events will
carry event linkages (previous event IDs) just like their normal path
siblings.  It is the task of the Protocol Verifier to distinguish normal
and unhappy event instances based upon their event names/types as
prescribed in the job definition.

Thus, the plan will be to update the Protocol Verifier job definition
schema to be fully expressive while leaving the runtime event instance
schema unmodified.  The job definition will treat unhappy path
audit event definitions as distinct from normal sequenced audit event
definitions.

=== 4.2 Package Name

Unhappy path audit event definitions are defined within packages rather
than within sequences in the job definition.  At present there is no functional
significance to the name of the package containing unhappy path audit event
definitions.  However, it seems prudent to pass this information
downstream to the Protocol Verifier for the following reasons:

* It is easy.
* It is consistent with passing the name of the sequence as we do for
  sequenced audit event definitions.
* This information could become useful in the future.

Multiple packages and nested packages are supported by PLUS.  The package
carries no semantic significance but is a nice feature for organisational
clarity in the job definition.

== 5 Work Required

=== 5.1 Unhappy Path Expression

It is noted that PLUS syntax for unhappy path event expression exists as a
result of work accomplished in a previous stage.  However, this syntax has
not been employed anywhere outside of 'plus2json' and may need adjustment.

==== 5.1.1 Testing of Existing Syntax

. Define a set of job definitions which include unhappy path events.
  Include syntactically correct and incorrect job definitions.
. Employ multiple and nested packages in these job definitions.
. Process these job definitions with 'plus2json' to ensure they parse
  correct syntax and give errors for incorrect syntax.

==== 5.1.2 PV Job Definition JSON Schema

. Update the Protocol Verifier job definition JSON schema to support
  unhappy path audit event definitions.
. Update the Protocol Verifier job definition JSON schema to support
  marking normal sequenced audit events with a new attribute indicating
  that the audit event is considered "critical".

=== 5.2 Job Definition JSON Production

. Enhance the model of PLUS and associated population and runtime
  subsystems to support unhappy path event definitions.
. In the 'plus2json' application, supply methods on the tree-walker to
  populate the model of PLUS.
. Supply methods to emit job definitions as schema-compliant JSON.

=== 5.3 Runtime Event Production (--play)

. Enhance 'plus2json' to emit runtime event instances which include
  unhappy path events using some reasonable strategy.

== 6 Acceptance Test

. `regression.sh` must continue to pass.
. `run_benchmark.sh` must continue to function.
. Test using the PVprime job definition.

== 7 Document References

. [[dr-1]] https://onefact.atlassian.net/browse/MUN2-117[MUN2-117 plus2json updates for unhappy paths]
