= plus2json --play Graph Coverage

xtUML Project Analysis Note

== 1 Abstract

This note enumerates the requirements, analysis and work required for an
enhancement to `plus2json --play`.  The enhancement causes plus2json to
produce sets of audit event instance streams that traverse alternatives
pathways to visit every audit event definition in a Protocol Verifier PLUS
job definition.

== 2 Introduction and Background

'plus2json' has a feature triggered by a command line switch: '--play'.
Thus, the engineers have begun referring to the feature as "plus2json
play".  This feature interprets PLUS job definitions and "plays" out
runtime audit event instance streams compliant to the job definitions.
The value to the testing of the Protocol Verifier cannot be over stated,
especially since a source of production input audit event streams data has
been unavailable early in the project.

The current (July 2023) '--play' is limited to producing only one legal
pathway through a job definition.  So, only the one pathway is tested.
Any particular job definition may have many legal pathways through it.

This work extends 'plus2json --play' to be able to produce many or all
legal pathways through a given job definition with the goal of achieving
graph coverage.

It shall be called `plus2json --playall`.

=== 2.1 Definitions

In the sections following, terminology will be used according to the
following (coined) terms/definitions.

upstream:: One feature of a job definition (audit event definition,
_fork_, _alternative_, etc) is _upstream_ in the directed graph from
another feature if it precedes the other feature sequentially in the job
definition.

downstream:: One feature of a job definition (audit event definition,
_fork_, _alternative_, etc) is _downstream_ from another feature if it
succeeds the other feature sequentially in the job definition.

fork:: an audit event definition with multiple different audit event
definitions following directly after it.  A _fork_ can be constrained as
an AND fork (all _tines_ are traversed) or an XOR _fork_ (only one _tine_
is traversed) in any legal _pathway_.  A Fork is a class in the
'population' subsystem of the PLUS data model.

tine:: a sequence of one or more audit event definitions proceeding
directly from a fork.  The sequence of one or more audit event definitions
proceeding from the start of a loop is also considered a _tine_.  A Tine
is a class in the 'population' subsystem of the PLUS data model.

terminal tine:: a tine which does not merge (ends in 'detach')

alternative:: a _tine_ proceeding from an XOR fork.  This will be modelled
as the 'Alternative' class in the enhanced 'population' subsystem of the
PLUS data model.  An _alternative_ implies a choice to be made at runtime.
It thus implies multiple _pathways_.

pathway:: a complete sequence of runtime audit event instances starting
with the first audit event in a job definition and proceeding legally
through any _forks_, _tines_ and _alternatives_ to the end of the job.
This will be modelled as the 'Pathway' class in the enhanced 'population'
subsystem of the PLUS data model.

graph coverage:: the percentage of audit event definitions in a given job
definition visited at least once by a set of _pathways_

== 3 Requirements

The goal of this work is to enumerate a set of _pathways_ which achieve
full _graph coverage_ of a given job definition by visiting each audit
event definition at least once.

=== 3.1 Multiple Different Pathways

'plus2json --playall' shall traverse multiple different pathways through a
single job definition when alternatives are present.

=== 3.2 Tine Coverage

'plus2json --playall' shall traverse multiple different pathways covering
all tines in all forks, thus covering all alternatives.

=== 3.3 Command Line Control

'plus2json' shall accept a command line switch (`--playall`) to enable
traversal of multiple pathways through the given set of job definitions
seeking to achieve 100% graph coverage.

== 4 Analysis

=== 4.1 Graph Traversal in Computer Science

Graph traversal is a well-studied subject within the field of Computer
Science.  Specifically, work on <<dr-2, Breadth First (Tree) Search>> is
applicable to the problem being solved by this work.  Efficient algorithms
exist which traverse trees ensuring a visit to every node.  However,
because of merges and loops in the graphs of PLUS job definitions, direct
application of breadth first search algorithms is limited.  It is noted
that XOR forks represent nodes in a tree structure.

=== 4.2 Alternatives and Pathways

'plus2json' relies heavily on an underlying model of PLUS.  The core of
this model is the 'definition' subsystem establishing the foundational
elements of a PLUS job definition.  A 'population' subsystem captures
elements of the syntax of PLUS including loops, forks with their
associated tines and the fragments of the language that structure the
definition.  A third subsystem, 'runtime' defines the shape of runtime
instances as they are produced interpretively from the definitions.

The 'population' subsystem is enhanced to reveal and contain the
multiplicity of alternatives and pathways through the definition.  These
alternatives and pathways are then methodically traversed during runtime
play of the job definitions.

=== 4.2.1 Alternative Names

PLUS supports a label next to 'if', 'elseif', 'else', 'switch' and 'case'.
These have not been used semantically by PLUS but are supported to enable
clarification on the PlantUML rendered activity diagram.  In this work,
these labels are now recognised and stored in the Name attribute of the
Alternative class.  This may be useful in the future to allow explicit
selection of individual pathways (containing the named alternative) for
'--play'.  The initial delivery of this work will support '--play' for the
first pathway or '--playall' for all pathways.  There is presently no
support for selecting a particular pathway.

=== 4.3 Graph Coverage

Alternatives and pathways are key in achieving and measuring graph
coverage.  When all alternatives and all pathways have been traversed,
full graph coverage is achieved and is measured and reported.

== 5 Work Required

=== 5.1 Data Model

Update the 'population' subsystem data model of PLUS to include two new
classes:  'Alternative' and 'Pathway'.

Each instance of Pathway represents a unique legal traversal through the
job definition.  Pathways are related to a containing job definition.
Every job definition has at least one pathway, even if there are no
alternatives.  Jobs with alternatives have more than one pathway.

An 'Alternative' is associated with a tine on an XOR fork.  Alternatives
can be related to each other reflexively as upstream and downstream from
one another.  An alternative can be downstream from only one other
(immediate) alternative.  An alternative can be upstream from multiple
other (immediate) alternatives.

Instances of Fork can now be nested (contained) within an instance of a
Tine (across R64).  This relationship is used to maintain scoping of
alternative tines.

=== 5.2 Updated Population

Update the population processing (as driven by the walking of the PLUS
abstract syntax tree).  Populate instances of 'Pathway' and 'Alternative'.

==== 5.2.1 Create Alternatives

When a tine is created, if it is a tine on a fork with an XOR constraint,
create an instance of Alternative and link it to the tine across R63.

==== 5.2.2 Link Upstream/Downstream Alternatives

With a new tine and alternative in hand, navigate up the nesting fork
hierarchy (R64) to the first upstream alternative if one exists.  Link the
downstream alternative to the upstream alternative across R62.

==== 5.2.3 Create/Link Alternative Pathways

Select all end-of-stream instances of Alternative (those having no
downstream alternative across R62).  These instances represent the "leaf
nodes" of the alternative tree.  Create an instance of Pathway.  Link this
pathway to the end-of-stream alternative and to all upstream alternatives
(navigating R62 to each upstream alternative).  This pathway and linked
set of alternatives will guide the interpretation of the job definition
for this pathway.

If there are no alternatives in a particular job definition, create an
ordinal instance of Pathway to serve as the one-and-only pathway through
a simple sequence job definition.  All job definitions have at least one
pathway even if there are no alternatives (XOR forking) in the topology.

=== 5.3 Extended Job Definition Interpretation

=== 5.3.1 Playing Pathways

Enable '--playall' to select all instances of Pathway related to the Job
Definition.  At job creation (instance of Job), link the job to the
selected pathway.  As the interpretation encounters XOR forks, select
through the linked tines and alternatives to the pathway.  Choose to play
down the tine which is linked through the alternative to a pathway
matching the one currently being played.

=== 5.3.2 Coverage Reporting

Add reporting to the end of '--playall' sessions.  Report the number of
pathways played and the graph coverage as a percentage of Audit Event
Definitions visited.

Graph coverage can be calculated by selecting all Audit Event Definition
instances and attempting to traverse to Audit Event.  Any Audit Event
Definition participating in R109 (with Audit Event) has been covered.

=== 5.4 Command Line Control

Provide a command line switch, '--playall' to enable playing all pathways
through the given job definitions (as opposed to playing only a single
pathway).

== 6 Acceptance Test

* `regression.sh` must run correctly.
* Graph coverage must equal or approach 100%.  Anything less than 100%
  must be explainable.
