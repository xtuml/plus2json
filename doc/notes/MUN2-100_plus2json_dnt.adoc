= PLUS-to-JSON Desin

xtUML Project Design Note

== 1 Abstract

This note documents the design of the 'plus2json' utility.

== 2 Introduction and Background

A language named 'PLUS' (roughly PlantUML Sequences) is defined using UML
Activity Diagram syntax.  This language supplies a syntax with which
"protocol jobs" may be expressed.  Protocol jobs prescribe the sequencing
of audit events produced during the execution of some system or device
adhering to an explicit protocol.  PLUS job definitions are used to
configure a __Protocol Verifier__ enabling it to monitor runtime
performance of a device and enforce adherence to the prescribed protocol
as expressed in the PLUS job definitions.

'plus2json' is a utility which converts PLUS job definitions into a JSON
format consumable by a Protocol Verifier.  'plus2json' performs other
tasks as documented in this design note.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 PLUS Language Definition (Grammar)

. 'plus2json' shall define the legal syntax of the PLUS language.
. 'plus2json' shall express the legal syntax of PLUS in an `antlr4`
  grammar (expressed in Backus-Naur Form).

=== 3.2 PLUS Parser

. 'plus2json' shall implement a parser which performs lexical analysis and
  parses input PLUS job definitions enforcing correct syntax.
. The 'plus2json' parser shall report syntax errors clearly enough that a
  user receives sufficient feedback to repair erroneous PLUS job definitions.

=== 3.3 PLUS Tree Walker

. 'plus2json' shall employ a mechanism to convert the textual PLUS job
  definition into an absract data model derived from a Shlaer-Mellor class
  diagram.
. 'plus2json' shall employ a method of conversion (from textual PLUS into
  data model instances) that minimises coupling between the PLUS syntax and
  the abstract data model.

=== 3.4 PLUS Job Definition Data Model

. At the core of 'plus2json' shall be a data structure derived from an
  abstract data model of the PLUS job definition domain.
. The 'plus2json' data model shall abstract the key concepts of the PLUS
  job definition domain including definition elements such a 'job',
  'sequence', 'audit event' and 'invariant'.
. The 'plus2json' data model shall (also) abstract run-time data elements
  conforming to the definition elements.

=== 3.5 PLUS Job Definition JSON

. 'plus2json' shall convert input PLUS job definitions expressed as PLUS
  into JSON compliant with a format consumable by a Protocol Verifier.

=== 3.6 Protocol Verifier Configuration

. 'plus2json' shall assist in the production of configuration files (in
  JSON format) for the Protocol Verifier.

=== 3.7 PLUS Job Definition Play

. 'plus2json' shall interpret PLUS job definitions and produce run-time
  audit event instance streams in JSON format compliant with the schema
  prescribed by the Protocol Verifier.
. 'plus2json' shall produce legal audit event instance streams in
  conformance with given job definitions.
. 'plus2json' shall produce multiple legal audit event instance streams to
  provide coverage of all possible paths (excluding variance in repetition)
  through a legal job definition.

== 4 Analysis

== 5 Design

=== 5.1 PLUS Language Definition (Grammar)

The grammar for 'plus2json' is defined in `plus2json.g4`.  The production
rules for the parser are supplied at the top.  The lexical tokens for the
keywords and syntax are supplied at the bottom.

=== 5.2 PLUS Parser

The PLUS parser is automatically generated from the antlr4 grammar.  The
command used to produce the parser is as follows:

`antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 plus2json.g4`

=== 5.3 PLUS Tree Walker

A listener pattern is used to override 'enter' and 'exit' methods on a
tree-walking pass of the parser.  These methods have access to the textual
tokens and identifiers being parsed from the PLUS job definition.  The
population of the PLUS job definition data model is realised by invoking
model element constructors during the parse.

The listener methods are packaged in `plus2json_run.py`.

=== 5.4 PLUS Job Definition Data Model

The 'plus2json' data model is a set of Python classes (indirectly) derived
from a Shlaer-Mellor class diagram.  Both class-based and instance-based
attributes are employed as appropriate.  Both class-based and
instance-based operations are defined on the classes.  Association links
are realised using reference attributes.

The data structures and operations at the core of 'plus2json' are defined
in `plus_job_defn.py`.

== 6 Design Comments

=== 6.1 antlr4

antlr4 is a widely (perhaps most widely) used and popular parser
generator.  The requirement for a grammar-based language drove this design
choice.  All other design choices follow from this one.

antlr4 can generate parsers from a grammar, but it also supports a means
of loosely coupling language transformations to the grammar.  The grammar
remains pure with no language transformation statements within the
grammar.  antlr4 provides a means to "walk" the abstract syntax tree of a
given parse instance.  "listeners" are supplied to be invoked at key
stages within the parse.

The listener pattern was chosen over the alternate "visitor" pattern.
The listener pattern is the default, is simpler than the visitor pattern
and is sufficient for our purposes.

=== 6.2 Python

After antlr4 was chosen, Python was chosen.  Python is supported along
with Java, which was the second choice.  Unfortunately, antlr4 does not
(yet) support MASL or any of the Shlaer-Mellor dialects.

=== 6.3 Segregation of Behaviour ("mixin" pattern)

An attempt has been made to segregate and package the behaviour of various
features.  This is accomplished using inheritance in a "mixin" pattern.
Specific behaviours are factored out into supertype classes.

The following behaviours are segregated using this strategy:

* AEO configuration (`plus_job_defn_aeo.py)
* JSON production (`plus_job_defn_json.py)
* play (`plus_job_defn_play.py)
* print (`plus_job_defn_print.py)
* AESim (to be deprecated)
* AEStest (to be deprecated)

=== 6.3 Build and Packaging

Packaging attempts to follow the Python Way.  However, it can be improved
upon.

=== 6.4 Testing

Unit tests are defined in separate files using the Python 'unittest'
package.  These tests are discovered by the continuous integration (CI) flow
and run upon creation of pull requests (PRs) targeted for the 'main'
branch.

Some test scripts have been written to exercise 'plus2json'.  These are
run with the following command.  There is no automation of
success/failure.  At present, if they do not crash, they are considered
successful.

 sh ./regress_j_p.sh ; sh ./regress_json.sh; sh ./regress_parser.sh; sh ./regress_play.sh; sh ./regress_w_compare.sh
