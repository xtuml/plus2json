document.

==== 7.1.1 Release plus2json First

. Branch the plus2json repository.
. Bump the 'version' values in `bundle.py` and `setup.py`.
. Bundle plus2json.
  .. Export BPHOME as a path leading to your installation of BridgePoint.
     ... `export BPHOME=~/xtuml/2023-11-30txt/BridgePoint.app/Contents/Eclipse`
  .. Export WORKSPACE as a path leading to a workspace containing the
     xtUML model of PLUS.
     ...  `export WORKSPACE=~/ws/plus1`
  .. Run the bundle script.
     ... `python bundle.py`
     ... Ensure it ran cleanly with no errors and produced a new `plus2json.pyz`.
  .. Copy `plus2json.pyz` to your `munin/bin` folder.
. Commit and push.
. Prepare a pull request.
. Review and service the pull request.
. Create new release using GitHub.
  .. 'Releases' (within right-hand panes).
  .. 'Draft a new release'
  .. 'Choose a tag'
  .. Create a new tag following the existing naming pattern.
  .. Paste a link to the release notes document or type a short summary of
     the release in the body of the release.
  .. 'Publish release'
